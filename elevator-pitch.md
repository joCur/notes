# Elevator Pitch: Voice-First Note-Taking App

## The 30-Second Pitch

"We're building a revolutionary note-taking app that lets you capture thoughts at the speed of speech. While traditional note apps force you to type, ours puts voice-first dictation at the center—making note-taking truly hands-free. Combine that with intelligent tag-based organization, powerful full-text search, and a brutally custom design that rethinks the entire note-taking experience, and you have a tool built for how people actually think and work today."

## The 60-Second Pitch

"Traditional note-taking is broken. You're stuck typing on a keyboard when your thoughts move faster than your fingers. We're creating a note-taking app that captures ideas at the speed of thought through advanced speech-to-text technology.

Here's what makes us different: Voice is our primary input method—not an afterthought. Dictate notes hands-free, then seamlessly edit and format them with our intuitive WYSIWYG editor. Organize everything through a flexible combination of tags and folder structures that adapts to how you think, not how software thinks. Find anything instantly with powerful full-text search across your entire knowledge base.

But the real difference? We're not just adding features to an old paradigm. We've rethought note-taking from the ground up with a custom design that challenges conventions and prioritizes speed, accessibility, and natural workflow.

This is note-taking reimagined for people who think fast and can't afford to slow down."
